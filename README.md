# Squanch Store

I am creating this new project to help refresh my memory. It has been well over a year since I last coded and decided it's time to stop slacking and get back into head on. With this, I decided there is no better way to refresh my memory than to go head first into a new project. This is going to be an e-commerce site dedicated to selling a specific product or type of product. As to what that product is, I don't know yet but it's not really important. Wish me luck!
